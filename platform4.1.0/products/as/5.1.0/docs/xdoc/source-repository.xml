    <h1>WSO2 Application Server Source Repository</h1>
    WSO2 AppServer is developed on top of the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon platform. You might need the
    source of the Carbon platform as well apart from the AppServer source code. Please note that both
    AppServer and the Carbon platform is open source and the code is available under the Apache
    Software License v2.0.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project uses <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
        to manage its source code. Instructions on Subversion use can be found at
        <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/</a>.</p>

    <h2>Source code of the AppServer 5.0.2 release</h2>
    <p>The following is a link to the online source tag of the WSO2 AppServer 5.0.2 release (Carbon 4.0.0).</p>

    <p><a href="http://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/tags/carbon/3.2.0/">
        http://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/tags/carbon/3.2.0/</a></p>

    <p>The complete source including the carbon platform can be checked out anonymously from
        SVN with this command:</p>
    <div class="source">
        <pre>$ svn checkout http://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/tags/carbon/3.2.0/ wso2carbon</pre>
    </div>

    <p>The list of commands that can be run are as follows. If you only
        want to build the WSO2 AppServer, you have to always use the option "-Dproduct=as".<br/></p>

    <table border="1">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>mvn clean install -Dproduct=as</strong></td>
                <td>To create the complete release artifacts of WSO2 AppServer including the
                    binary and source distributions.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dproduct=as</strong></td>
                <td>To create the complete release artifacts of WSO2 AppServer including the binary and
                    source distributions, without running any of the unit tests.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dproduct=as -o</strong></td>
                <td>To create the complete release artifacts of WSO2 AppServer including the binary and
                    source distributions, without running any of the unit tests, in offline mode. This
                    can be done only if you've already built the source at least once.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Source code of the WSO2 AppServer trunk</h2>
        <p>Everyone can access the Subversion repository via HTTPS, but Committers must checkout
            the Subversion repository via HTTPS.
        </p>

        <p>The Carbon framework related source code can be checked out from the
            following commands.</p>

        <div class="source">
            <pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/trunk/carbon carbon</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The Carbon core project is the root project of the OSGi platform on whcih all the Java
            product stack is built on top of, and the carbon-components contains all the components
            not just AppServer specific components. So you obviously need to build just the set of
            components required by the AppServer, which can be achieved through;
        </p>

        <div class="source">
            <pre>$ mvn clean install -Dproduct=as</pre>
        </div>

        <p>To commit changes to the repository, execute the following command (svn will prompt
            you for your password)
        </p>
        <div class="source">
            <pre>$ svn commit --username your-username -m "A message"</pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Access from behind a firewall</h2>
        <p>For those users who are stuck behind a corporate firewall which is blocking http access
            to the Subversion repository, you can try to access it via the developer connection:
        </p>
        <div class="source">
            <pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/trunk/carbon carbon</pre>
        </div>
        <h2>Access through a proxy</h2>
        <p>The Subversion client can go through a proxy, if you configure it to do so.
            First, edit your "servers" configuration file to indicate which proxy to use. The
            files location depends on your operating system. On Linux or Unix it is
            located in the directory "~/.subversion". On Windows it is in "%APPDATA%\Subversion".
            (Try "echo %APPDATA%", note this is a hidden directory.)
        </p>
        <p>There are comments in the file explaining what to do. If you don't have that file, get
            the latest Subversion client and run any command; this will cause the configuration
            directory and template files to be created.
        </p>
        <p>Example : Edit the 'servers' file and add something like :</p>
        <div class="source">
            <pre>[global]
http-proxy-host = your.proxy.name
http-proxy-port = 3128
            </pre>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
