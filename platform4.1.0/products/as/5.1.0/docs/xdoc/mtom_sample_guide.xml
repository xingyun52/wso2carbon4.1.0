<h1>MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism)</h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p> This sample demonstrates the capabilities and power of MTOM. MTOM Web Service accepts a
    fileName and DataHandler. This DataHandler contains the binary content which will eventually save to a
    temporary location to the given fileName. </p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Apache Ant 1.6.2 or higher. </p>


<h2>Running the Sample:</h2>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Use "ant generate.service" or just "ant" command in the CARBON_HOME/samples/MTOM/ to build the
        service.
    </li>
    <li>Generated service (MTOMSample.aar) gets copied to the $CARBON_HOME/repository/deployment/server/axis2services
        automatically.
    </li>
    <li>Start AppServer server using $CARBON_HOME/bin/wso2server.sh or $CARBON_HOME/bin/wso2server.bat.</li>
    <li>Use the script run-client.sh or run-client.bat file to invoke the client using arguments</li>

    <p>-file {file that need to be send to the service} -fileName {name to be copied on server side} ex:</p>

    <p>./run-client.sh -file /tmp/wwe.jpg -fileName wresting.jpg</p>
</ol>
<h2>Note</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it may be necessary to clean the services repository before you generate the service, deploy it
and run the client. (i.e. delete services created from previous samples.)</p>
