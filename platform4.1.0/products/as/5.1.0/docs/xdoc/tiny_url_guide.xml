<h1>TinyURL Sample Guide</h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In this sample the capabilities of WSO2 AppServer to handle both SOAP and Representational State
    Transfer (REST) will be demonstrated. These capabilities are demonstrated with the help of a web
    service form which a shorter URL can be obtained by submitting a longer URL</p>

<h2>SCENARIO</h2>

<p>As many of you probably know we can submit a long URL and obtain a shorter URL from <a
        href="http://www.tinyurl.com">www.tinyurl.com.</a></p>

<p>We can simply develop a web service that provides the same functionality. The beauty of this web
    service is that the same service can be used by a desktop client or a web browser to obtain a
    URL and by a browser to go to the web page represented by the URL obtained without any
    additional Servlet or JSP logic or any shared database instance.</p>

<p>We can identify two main requirements at this point:</p>

<p>Any user of the service should be able to obtain a URL from the service by submitting any URL,
    Any user should be able to use a URL provided by the service to access the original web
    page.</p>

<p>The service will have to have two operations to support the above two scenarios.</p>

<p><b>addUrl - </b>Allows a URL to be added to the service and provides a new URL which can be used
    to access the page of the original URL.</p>
<b>go - </b>When this operation is invoked with a URL obtained from the service it will return HTML
text to that will contain the original URL in an iframe.


<h2>HOW TO BUILD AND RUN THE SAMPLE</h2>

<p>TUrl-Rest sample is in CARBON_HOME|samples|TinyURL folder.</p>

<p>To build the samples you need the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache
    Ant</a> build tool.</p>

<h3>Now Follow The Simple Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Run WSO2 AppServer. See <a
            href="../../../docs/installation_guide.html">Installation
        Guide</a> for installation details.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Switch to the TinyURL directory, e.g.</p>
        <pre style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">  cd CARBON_HOME/samples/TinyURL</pre>
    </li>
    <li><pre style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">From there simply type
  ant</pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>You should see messages like this:</h4>
<pre style="text-indent: 1.93cm">Buildfile: build.xml

build-all:

     [copy] Copying 1 file to /home/user/wso2as-5.0.2/repository/deployment/server/axis2services

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 2 seconds

</pre>
<ol start="3">
    <p>The build automatically copies the .aar file containing the service into
        the repository.</p>
    <li><p>If you select the 'Web Services -> List' page in the Management Console,
        you should now see the TinyUrl service deployed. If you don't see it, try reloading/refreshing the 
	page.</p>

        <p>(See <a
                href="../../../docs/user_guide.html">Administrator's
            Guide</a> on how to sign into Management Console and to navigate through
            it.)</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Lets illustrate the above options using an example:</h3>


<ol start="3">
    <p>For example, if the URL we need to submit is <a
            href="http://wso2.com/">http://wso2.com/</a> then, type the longer URL in the
        text box and submit it. You can access the TinyURL service via <a href="http://localhost:9763/TinyURL">http://localhost:9763/TinyURL</a></p>
    <img alt="" src="images/tiny_url/Screenshot00.jpg"/><br clear="all"/>

    <p>When you submit the shorter URL a HTTP GET request is sent to
        http://127.0.0.1:9763/services/TinyURL/addUrl with the "URL" parameter holding the longer
        URL.</p>

    <p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:9763/services/TinyURL/addUrl?url=http://www.wso2.com">http://localhost:9763/services/TinyURL/addUrl?url=http://www.wso2.com</a>
        is REST call to TinyURL web service</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>Then you should see an URL similar to the following one:</strong></p>
<ol start="3"><p><a href="https://127.0.0.1:9443/services/TinyURL/go?id=1340973355">https://127.0.0.1:9443/services/TinyURL/go?id=1340973355</a>
</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/tiny_url/Screenshot01.jpg"/><br clear="all"/>
    <p>Click the above URL to access <a href="http://www.wso2.com/">http://www.wso2.com</a>.</p>
</ol>
