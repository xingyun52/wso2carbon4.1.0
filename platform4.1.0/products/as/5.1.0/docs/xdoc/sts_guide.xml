        <h1>Security Service Token Sample Guide</h1>
        <p>In this sample we will demonstrate the usage of wso2carbon-sts service and its applications.
            The demonstration of this sample also uses the default Hello service as the service provider.
        </p>
        <h2>HOW TO BUILD AND RUN THE SAMPLE</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Setup the sample by running the given Apache Ant build. $ ant</li>

            <li>Start WSO2 AppServer (If you haven't already started it).</li>
            <li>Log into WSO2 AppServer administration console.</li>
            <li>Select &quot;wso2carbon-sts&quot; service and setup security scenario &quot;Sign and encrypt - X509
                Authentication&quot; (scenario 5) on it.
                Make sure wso2carbon.jks keystore (wso2carbon keystore) is used.
            </li>
            <li>Select &quot;HelloService&quot; service and copy the http service address.
                Select &quot;wso2carbon-sts&quot; service and navigate to &quot;STS Configuration&quot; link
                (which is under the "Specific Configuration" section of the service dashboard).
                Paste/type the http endpoint address of &quot;HelloService&quot; service
                (http://10.100.1.105:9763/services/HelloService) in
                &quot;Add new trusted service&quot;-&gt;&quot;Endpoint Address&quot;.
                Select the wso2carbon private key's certificate alias (wso2carbon) from the drop down list.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>Import sts-sample/conf/client.cert into the wso2carbon keystore using the
                WSO2 AppServer admin console.
            </li>
            <li>Run client
                $ ./run-client.sh &lt;wso2carbon-sts-http-address&gt; &lt;hello-service-http-address&gt;
                OR
                run-client.bat &lt;wso2carbon-sts-http-address&gt; &lt;hello-service-http-address&gt;
                <br/>
                <strong>Note :</strong> This hello service http address should be exactly the same address you
