        <h1>Chad Sample Guide</h1>

        <p>
            <img src="images/chad/polling_station.jpg"/>
        </p>

        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

        <p>Chad is a simple voting service. It has two perspectives; a user
            perspective &amp; an administration perspective. The user perspective is the
            default one, which allows a user to vote for a particular poll, as well as
            view the results of a poll. In addition, in the administration perspective,
            an authorized administrator can;
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create new polls</li>
            <li>Start polls (which have been stopped)</li>
            <li>Stop polls (which are currently active)</li>
            <li>Create accounts for new administrators</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Only
            <strong>one vote per poll is allowed for a particular IP
                address
            </strong>
            , and the poll results can be compared using the bar graphs
            and the relevant percentages of votes each choice has received. If you try
            voting again using the same IP you will be directed to the poll results page,
            also including the line, &quot;We have already received a vote for this poll from
            your IP address. Hence you are not eligible for voting&quot; below the results
            graph.
        </p>

        <h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>CARBON_HOME : Directory to which you installed WSO2 AppServer.</li>
            <li>MGT_CONSOLE_URL : This is the URL that will be used to access the
                management console. This will be <a href="https://localhost:9443/carbon">
		https://localhost:9443/carbon</a>. This can vary depending on your installation
                type and the configuration.
            </li>
            <li>CHAD_URL : This URL is used to open the CHAD GUI Application. This will
                be <a href="http://localhost:9763/Chad">http://localhost:9763/Chad</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>DEPLOYING THE CHAD SERVICE</h2>

        <p>To build the samples you need the
            <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache
                Ant
            </a>
            build tool.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First install WSO2 AppServer (See
                <a href="installation_guide.html">Installation Guide</a> for details).
            </li>
            <li>In the command prompt go to
                <code>CARBON_HOME/samples/Chad</code>
            </li>
            <li>Type <code>ant</code> at the command prompt.
            </li>
            <li>Execute the WSO2 AppServer starting script.</li>
            <li>Check your WSO2 AppServer instance using this URL  <a href="https://localhost:9443/carbon">
		https://localhost:9443/carbon</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now you will have the Chad service deployed on WSO2 AppServer. You can check
            this by going to the
            <a href="user_guide.html">Management Console</a>
            and clicking on the &quot;Manage -&gt; Service -&gt; List&quot; link on
            the left menu. If you see the Chad service listed here, then you know for
            sure that Chad is active/deployed.
        </p>

        <h2>RUNNING THE WEB BASED CHAD CLIENT</h2>

        <p>You can run the client using a Web browser interface.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Run the WSO2 AppServer Server (See
                <a href="installation_guide.html">Installation Guide </a>
                for instructions on installation)
            </li>
            <li>You can get to the WSO2 AppServer Management Console, sign in,
                    then click on &quot;Manage -&gt; Service -&gt; List&quot; link on the left menu. As Chad service is
                    already deployed you will see the service listed on the page.
                           To run the chad client visit
                    <a href="http://localhost:9763/Chad">http://localhost:9763/Chad</a>
			 this url will take you to the web based UI of
                    chad application
                    (See <a href="user_guide.html">User Guide</a> for details for details)
            </li>
            <li>Now you will see the user view of the Chad system as shown below. If
                there are no Active polls, then the page will read as &quot;No polls present&quot;. An active poll is a poll open for voting. A normal user
                can <a href="#vote">vote</a> using the &quot;Vote&quot; action. He can also see
                <a href="#results">poll results</a> by clicking on the particular poll title.

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Do an Administrator Login with the given default username and password
                to have access to administrator privileges to the Chad system. Once
                logged in as Admin you will have access to the following features
                <ul>
                    <a id="active_polls"></a>
                    <li>Active polls- lists polls that are open for voting. Here you have
                        the option of either <strong>stopping</strong> the poll or
                        <strong>voting</strong>. If you click on the name of the poll it will list the
                        <a href="#results">poll results</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Create a poll <br/><br/>
                        <p>
                            <img alt="Figure 1: Create Poll" src="images/chad/create.jpg"/>
                        </p>
                        <br/><br/>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Vote types</strong>
                            available are 'Single Choice' where one
                            can only vote for a single choice and 'Multiple Choice' where one can
                            vote for one or more choices.
                        </p>  <br/>
                        <p>Note: Once a poll is created it is automatically open for voting.
                            Voting is open until explicitly closed using
                            <a>stop option</a>
                        </p>

                        click on the particular poll
                        listed on any of the Polls lists pages. You will get a page as shown
