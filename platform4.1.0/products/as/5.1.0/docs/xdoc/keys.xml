<h1>Change the WSO2 AppServer Crypto Keys</h1>

    <p>WSO2 AppServer  uses a key pair to enable HTTPS and to secure the user passwords
        within it. You can find the default keystore and the client trust store in
        CARBON_HOME/repository/resources/security folder.</p>

    <p>When you use WSO2 AppServer in production, it is <strong>strongly</strong>
        recommended that you change the default keys that are shipped with it.</p>

    <h2>Using the JDK keytool utility to create a keystore</h2>

    <p>It should be noted that the RSA algorithm must be used to generate the
        keypair. For example..</p>

    <pre>$ keytool -genkey -alias wso2appserver -keyalg RSA -keystore wso2appserver.jks -storepass wso2appserver</pre>

    <p>This will prompt a series of questions as shown below:</p>

<pre>What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  John Smith
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  Accounts
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  ABC
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  Colombo
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  Western
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  LK
Is CN=John Smith, OU=Accounts, O=ABC, L=Colombo, ST=Western, C=LK correct?
  [no]:  yes

Enter key password for &lt;tungsten&gt;
    (RETURN if same as keystore password):</pre>

    <p>Now you will see a file with the name "wso2appserver.jks" created in the
        location from which you executed the above command.</p>

    <p>Keystore management is a feature which is inherited from the WSO2 Carbon platform.
        WSO2 Carbon uses the keystores to secure passwords and to enable HTTPS.</p>

    <h2>Using your new keystore to secure user passwords and other sensitive information</h2>

    <p>You can use your new keystore for this purpose by pointing your keystore from the
        "Security" section of the CARBON_HOME/repository/conf/carbon.xml file as follows.
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;KeyStore&gt;
            &lt;!-- Keystore file location--&gt;
            &lt;Location&gt;${carbon.home}/repository/resources/security/wso2appserver.jks&lt;/Location&gt;
            &lt;!-- Keystore type (JKS/PKCS12 etc.)--&gt;
            &lt;Type&gt;JKS&lt;/Type&gt;
            &lt;!-- Keystore password--&gt;
            &lt;Password&gt;wso2appserver&lt;/Password&gt;
            &lt;!-- Private Key alias--&gt;
            &lt;KeyAlias&gt;wso2appserver&lt;/KeyAlias&gt;
            &lt;!-- Private Key password--&gt;
            &lt;KeyPassword&gt;wso2appserver&lt;/KeyPassword&gt;
        &lt;/KeyStore&gt;
    </pre>

    <h2>Using your new keystore to enable HTTPS</h2>

    <p>If you want to use your new keystore for this purpose, first you have to import
        your SSL certificates into your new keystore. Please refer to the above article for
        more information on how to do it.</p>

    <h3>Standalone Mode</h3>

    <p>When WSO2 AppServer is running in the standalone mode, you have to refer your keystore
        from CARBON_HOME/repository/conf/mgt-transports.xml file. Set the following parameters
        in the "https" transport configuration.</p>
    
    <pre>
        &lt;parameter name="keystoreFile"&gt;
            ${carbon.home}/repository/resources/security/wso2appserver.jks
        &lt;/parameter&gt;
        &lt;parameter name="keystorePass"&gt;wso2appserver&lt;/parameter&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>Running in a Servlet Container</h3>

    <p><strong>JBoss application server</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update the "SSL/TLS Connector configuration" section of the
            jboss_home/server/default/deploy/jbossweb-tomcat50.sar/server.xml
            <ul>
                <li>Full path to the keystore - keystoreFile</li>
                <li>Keystore password - keystorePass</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Apache Tomcat server</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update the "Define a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 9443" section
            of the catalina_home/conf/server.xml
            <ul>
                <li>Full path to the keystore - keystoreFile</li>
                <li>Keystore password - keystorePass</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
