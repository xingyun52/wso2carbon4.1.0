        <h1>HelloWorldWebapp Sample Guide</h1>

		<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>WSO2 AppServer supports Apache tomcat based web application deployment as a latest feature. 
			Now you can Deploy your custom web application under WSO2 AppServer. All you need to do is to bundle 
			your web application as a '.war' archive with all your web application-related resources and all third party 
			libraries needed, and then deploy the archive. This is a simple sample that demonstrates the functionality 
			of the Web Application deployment support in WSO2 Application Server.
        </p>

        <h2>BUILDING SAMPLE</h2>
        <ol type="1">

			<li>Start the WSO2AppServer server</li>
			<li>Switch to the HelloWorldWebapp sample directory</li>
			<pre>e.g. In <strong>MS Windows</strong> cd CARBON_HOME\samples\HelloWorldWebapp or in
	    <strong>Linux</strong> cd CARBON_HOME/samples/HelloWorldWebapp</pre>

			<li>Type ant and press enter</li>
			<pre>e.g. CARBON_HOME\samples\HelloWorldWebapp&gt;ant or
                CARBON_HOME/samples/HelloWorldWebapp$ ant</pre>

			<li>This will copy  the sample webapp (wso2appserver-samples-hello-webapp-1.0.war file) in the &quot;target&quot; 
				directory to the &quot;CARBON_HOME/repository/deployment/server/webapps/&quot; directory.
				If you start AppServer if its not already started,  will be available as a deployed webapp under 
				&quot;<strong>Manage&gt; Web Applications&gt; List</strong>&quot;.</li>
