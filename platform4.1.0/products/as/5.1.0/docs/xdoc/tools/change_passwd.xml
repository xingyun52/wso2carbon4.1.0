<h1>Change Password Tool</h1>

<p>This document explains how an admin user can change his or her
password.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>If an admin user forgets his password, he cannot retrieve it using the
Management Console due to security concerns. Furthermore, if you started WSO2
AppServer for the first time on one version of a JDK (say 1.4), and later decided
to switch to another version of a JDK (say 1.5), it becomes impossible for
WSO2 AppServer to decrypt the user passwords, since the security providers for
different JDKs are different. <br />
In such scenarios, you would have to change the relevant passwords by running
the chpasswd script on the machine that hosts the WSO2 AppServer server.</p>

<p>The chpasswd script is located in CARBON_HOME/bin</p>

<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT: Before executing this script, you should shutdown
the WSO2 AppServer instance.</em></strong></p>

<h2>What You Need to Know</h2>

<p>In order to change a user's password, you need to provide the following
information</p>
<ol>
  <li>The WSO2 AppServer database URL:
    <p>By default, WSO2 AppServer ships with the Apache Derby database and hence
    the default URL would be jdbc:h2:/home/<strong>[user
    name]</strong>/.wso2appserver/database/WSO2CARBON_DB (For Windows
    jdbc:h2:C:\Documents and Settings\<strong>[user
    name]</strong>\.wso2appserver\database\WSO2CARBON_DB) . This may differ if a
    different database was specified during the installation process.Then the
    URL will be in the form of jdbc:h2:CARBON_HOME/database/WSO2CARBON_DB,
    where CARBON_HOME will be the custom location specified during the
    installation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The Database driver class:
    <p>For the default H2 database, the driver will be
    automatically picked up by the system. If a different database is used,
    the driver class needs to be specified.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The Database username and password:
    <p>Again for the default H2 database, the default username and
    password will be used by the system. However, if a different
    username/password is used, you are required to reset the admin
    password.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The username and new password of the user whose password is to be
    changed:
    <p>If you do not provide these as command line arguments, you will be
    prompted for it during the execution.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Resetting the Password</h2>

<p>This script is located in CARBON_HOME/bin. Usually this is the directory
in which you have installed/extracted WSO2 AppServer.</p>

<p>The command line options available for chpasswd is as follows:</p>

<table border="1">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Command Line Option</b></td>
      <td><b>Description</b></td>
      <td><b>Mandatory?</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>--db-url</td>
      <td>The database URL</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>--db-driver</td>
      <td>The database driver class</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>--db-username</td>
      <td>The username for the database</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>--db-password</td>
      <td>The password for the database</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>--username</td>
      <td>The username of the user whose password is to be changed.<br />
        If this is not given, you will be prompted for this field later.</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>--new-password</td>
      <td>The new password of the user whose password is to be changed.<br />
        If this is not given, you will be prompted for this field later.</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre>chpasswd --db-url "jdbc:h2:CARBON_HOME/database/WSO2CARBON_DB"</pre>

<p><b>Example (on Windows)</b></p>
<pre>chpasswd --db-url "jdbc:h2:C:\Documents and Settings\user\.wso2appserver\database\WSO2CARBON_DB"</pre>

<p><b>Example (on *nix)</b></p>
<pre>chpasswd --db-url jdbc:h2:home/user/.wso2appserver/database/WSO2CARBON_DB</pre>

<p>If you have not provided the --username or --new-password input
parameters, the system will prompt you for it. If the password was updated
successfully, you should see the following message: <br />
<br />
<pre>Password of user [username] updated successfully</pre>
</p>

<h2>Important Note</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If the database path includes directory names with spaces, the whole
    URL needs to be included within quotations.
