        <h1>JibX Sample</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This sample demonstrates the usage of Jibx data binding that comes with Axis2. JiBX differs
            from other data binding techniques supported by Axis2 in that it allows you to use your own
            Java data objects (as opposed to Java data objects generated from a schema definition). JiBX also
            provides a
            nicer form of an unwrapped Web services interface than is supported by the other data
            binding techniques.
            On the downside, JiBX requires more setup than the other data binding techniques - in
            particular, you
            need to come up with a set of data classes and a binding definition in order to work
            with JiBX in Axis2.

        <h2>Building the Service</h2>
        <p>
            To build the sample service, go to the samples directory and type: "ant"

            This will build the LibraryService.aar file in the target directory and copy it to the
            &lt;CARBON_HOME&gt;/repository/deployment/server/axis2services directory.

            The WSDL for this service should be viewable at:

            http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/services/LibraryService?wsdl
        </p>
        <h2>Running the Client</h2>
        <p>
            To run a sample client for the service, go to samples directory and user either
            run-client.sh in Linux or
            run-client.bat in Windows.

            Otherwise, you can use AppServer features to generate the client stubs pointing to the wsdl and
            invoke the service with that,
            or you can invoke the service with the Try-It tool.
        </p>
