        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            This is an example JAXWS Web service. It shows how to expose the methods of a class as a
            JAXWS Web service using WSO2 Application Server .
        </p>

        <h1>Building the Service</h1>
        <p>To build the sample service, go to samples/JAXWS directory and type: ant.</p>

        <p>This will build the calculator-jaxws-sample.jar in the target directory and
            copy it to the CARBON_HOME/repository/deployment/server/servicejars directory. If
            you start AppServer, the deployed JAXWS service will be available under the services list.</p>

        <p>The WSDL for this service should be viewable at:</p>

        <div class="source">
            <pre>
                http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/services/Calculator?wsdl
            </pre>
        </div>

        <h1>Running the Client</h1>
        <p>
            To run the sample client for the service, go to samples directory and type: 
            <pre>sh run-client.sh/run-client.bat</pre></p>

        <p>For more information, use "-help" option.</p>

        <p>Otherwise, you can use following AppServer features to invoke the service.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the Try-It tool</li>
            <li>Generate the client stubs pointing to the wsdl and invoke the service
                with the generated client.</li>
        </ol>
