    <h1>Running behind an Apache HTTPD Proxy</h1>

    <p>In a production environment or if the network is under certain constrains, it is
        sometimes necessary to run WSO2 AppServer behind a proxy or a firewall. Even though AppServer
        should be behind a proxy or firewall, the ultimate end user should not see this
        information.</p>

    <p>Lets assume you have enabled
        <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html">mod_proxy</a>. Steps to
        enable proxy mode are as follows.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Open CARBON_HOME/repository/conf/axis2.xml file.</li>
        <li>Find the "transportReceiver" elements for 'http' and 'https' transports.</li>
        <li>Uncomment the "proxyPort" parameter in both 'http' and 'https' transport receivers.
            For example:
            <pre>
                &lt;parameter name="proxyPort"&gt;80&lt;/parameter&gt;
            </pre>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>AppServer has been designed to run on top of Embedded Tomcat or in Servlet containers
        such as Tomcat, JBoss, WebLogic etc. Thus, AppServer has two mode of operations. In any case,
        find the axis2.xml in CARBON_HOME/repository/conf directory and follow the above steps.</p>
