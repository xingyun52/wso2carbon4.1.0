operations 

- cacheSettings
Set the caching properties for a feed. prefetch determines whether the feed should be fetched regularly in the background (true), or only on demand (false). lifespan is the number of milliseconds that the feed should be cached; when prefetch=true, this is the refresh interval, when prefetch=false, this is how long a cached version should be used until it is considered stale.

- feedContent
Return the XML representation of the feed directly (updating the cache in the process). If the feed is stale, it will be refreshed. If the feed has not been cached before, it will be using the default settings of no prefetching, cache lifespan 24 hours.

- feedReference
Return a local reference to a cached feed. If the feed is stale, it will be refreshed. If the feed has not been cached before, it will be using the default settings of no prefetching, cache lifespan 24 hours.
