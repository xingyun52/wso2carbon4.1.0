Samples : mashup samples
===================

Introduction
============

'YahooGeoCode' mashup service wraps with the "http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/rest/V1/geocode.html" Yahoo! Maps Web Services - Geocoding API. It returns a specific latitude and longitude for given an address 

Building the Service
====================

1. Use "ant" command in the CARBON_HOME/samples/mashupSamples/ to deploy them.
2. This will copy directories in to the 
<CARBON_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/jsservices/admin directory. If you start AppServer, those services will be
available as a mashup services (jsservices).

Running the client
==================

Before using the geocode service, register for a Yahoo API Key [1] and use it to provision the service (write-once only).
