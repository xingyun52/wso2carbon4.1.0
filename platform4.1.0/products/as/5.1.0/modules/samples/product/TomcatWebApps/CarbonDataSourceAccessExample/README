Sample : CarbonDataSourceAccessExample
===================

Introduction
============

This is simple webapp sample to demonstrate JNDI look-ups for Carbon DataSources
which are exposed as JNDI resources from carbon in WSO2 Application Server

This will look up a carbon datasource , WSO2CarbonDB, which represents the db that is used for
registry and user management datasource details in Carbon and present some details of that datasource.

Like wise we can lookup for any Carbon Data Sources which are exposed as JNDI resources from within webapps.
