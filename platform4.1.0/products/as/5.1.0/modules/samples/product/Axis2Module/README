Axis2 Module Sample
===================

This is a simple sample which demonstrates how to write an Axis2 Module. More details about
Axis2 Modules can be found at [1].

This sample module introduces an In handler and an Out handler into the handler chain which
basically logs the incoming and outgoing messages.

Steps to try out :

1. Build the sample by running the 'mvn install' command. Or using 'ant' command
2. Copy the LogModule.mar file to CARBON_HOME/repository/deployment/server/axis2modules
directory. (This step is not necessary if you run 'ant' command)
3. Open the CARBON_HOME/repository/conf/log4j.properties file and add the following entry
into it. This sets the log level to DEBUG only for our logging module.

log4j.logger.org.wso2.carbon.log.module=DEBUG 

4. Start the server. 
5. Log into the management console and go to the service list and click on the HelloService 
service name and click on the "Modules" link under "Quality of Service Configuration". 
6. Engage module "logmodule".
7. Invoke the HelloService using Try-It. You should see the incoming and outgoing messages 
as DEBUG level logs. 

If you want to globally engage the module (to apply it for all your services), go to 
Manage > Modules > List and engage "logmodule".
