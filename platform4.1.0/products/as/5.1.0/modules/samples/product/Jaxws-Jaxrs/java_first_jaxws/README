Java First demo using jax-ws APIs and jsr-181
=============================================
This demo illustrates how to develop a service using the "code first"
approach using the JAX-WS APIs.

Building and running the demo using Maven
---------------------------------------
From the base directory of this sample (i.e., where this README file is
located), the pom.xml file is used to build and run the demo. 

Using either UNIX or Windows:
  * mvn clean install (builds the demo and creates a WAR file)
  * Start the server (run bin/wso2server.sh/.bat)
  * mvn -Pdeploy (deploys the generated WAR file on WSO2 AS with related logs on the console)
  * mvn -Pclient (runs the client)

NOTE :
  * To remove the code generated from the WSDL file and the .class files, run "mvn clean".


Building and running the demo using Ant
---------------------------------------
The base directory of this sample (i.e., where this README file is located) has the build.xml file
which is used to build the necessary webapp and deploy it in WSO2 App Server.

To build and deploy the sample,type :
  * ant

To run the sample demo :
  * Start the App Server and access the Management Console at https://localhost:9443/carbon. Go to the Jaxws-Jaxrs service listing
    page. You will see the deployed service.
  * You have to run the run-client.sh or run-client.bat script. It has all the arguments and classpaths configured to run the sample.
