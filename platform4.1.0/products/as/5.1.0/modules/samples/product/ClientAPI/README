Sample : ClientAPI
==================

Introductions
=============

This sample demonstrates the Axis2 Client API. There are different ways of writing clients for
Web Services and all those are covered by this sample.


Building the Service
====================

1. Use "ant" command in the CARBON_HOME/samples/ClientAPI/ to build the service.
2. This will create the ClientAPIDemoService (ClientAPIDemoService.aar file) in the "services" directory and
copy it to the <CARBON_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/axis2services directory.
If you start AppServer, ClientAPIDemoService will be available as a deployed service.

The WSDL for the service should be viewable at:
http://<host>:<port>/services/ClientAPIDemoService?wsdl


Running the client
==================

Use the script run-client.sh or run-client.bat file to invoke the client using following
optional parameters

   -help {For help on available options}
   -e {Endpoint URL}

Then select the type of Client that you want to execute.

1. Blocking Client
2. Single Channel Non Blocking Client
3. Dual Channel Non Blocking Client
4. Dynamic Blocking Client
5. RPC Client
6. Fire and Forget Client
7. Send Robust Client
8. Operation Client
9. Exit
