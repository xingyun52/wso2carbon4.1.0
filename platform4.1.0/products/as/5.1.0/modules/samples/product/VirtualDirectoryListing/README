Sample : Virtual Directory Listing
===================================

Introduction
===============

This sample is to demonstrate how to do vistual directory listing using a tomcat webapp.
In other words contents of a external directory anc be mapped and shown in the webapp UI.
This sample has functionality of both listing and downloading the given directory content.

Instructions for building and configuring the webapp are as following.

Configuring
============

1) Define the virtual directory mapping:
open the virtualwebapp/WEB-INF/web.xml and modify the parameter,
              <param-value>/path/to/virtual/directory/to/be/mapped/</param-value>
      replace the path with the absolute directory path you want to map

Building and deploying the Sample
==================================

2) Build and run the webapp:
run $ant. This will create and auto deploy the webapp into [CARBON_HOME]/repository/deployment/server/webapps

Contents of the packed the war will be as following
          WEB-INF
        |-- classes
        |   `-- org
        |       `-- wso2
        |           `-- carbon
        |               `-- servlets
        |                   `- DirectoryListServlet.class
        |-- jsp
        |   |-- download.jsp
        |   `-- list.jsp
        `-- web.xml

3) Check-out the virtual directory listing webapp,
goto webapp url, [3]
    eg: http://localhost:9763/virtual/
    if you want https,
    https://localhost:9443/virtual/
