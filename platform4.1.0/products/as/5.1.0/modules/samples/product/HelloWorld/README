Sample : HelloWorld
===================

Introduction
============

This is a simple sample that demonstrates the functionality of the Axis2 services 
deployed as web services in WSO2 Web Service Application Server . 


Building the Service
====================

1. Use "ant" command in the CARBON_HOME/samples/HelloWorld/ to build the service.
2. This will build the HelloWorld service in the target directory and copy it to the 
<CARBON_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/axis2services directory. If you start AppServer, HelloWorld will be
available as a deployed service. 

The WSDL for the service should be viewable at:
http://<host>:<port>/services/HelloService?wsdl


Running the client
==================

You can use AppServer features to generate the client stub pointing to the wsdl and
invoke the service with that, or invoke the service with Try-It.
