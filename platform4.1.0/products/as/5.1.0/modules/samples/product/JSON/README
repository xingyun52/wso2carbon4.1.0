Sample : JSON
=============

Introductions
=============

This is a simple sample that demonstrates the functionality of the JSON Support
in WSO2 Application Server.


Building the Service
====================

1. Use "ant" command in the CARBON_HOME/samples/JSON/ to build the service.
2. This will create the JSON service (JSONService.aar file) in the "services" directory and
copy it to the <CARBON_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/axis2services directory.
If you start AppServer, JSONService will be available as a deployed service.

The WSDL for the service should be viewable at:
http://<host>:<port>/services/JSONService?wsdl


Running the client
==================

Use the script run-client.sh or run-client.bat file to invoke the client using following
optional parameters
   -help {For help on available options}
   -e {Endpoint URL}
   -ct {Content type to be used}
        aj  (application/json)
        ajb (application/json/badgerfish)

   ex: ./run-client.sh -ct ajb
