<h1>Sample Installer</h1>

<p>
    As indicated in Figure 1, you could install either Web Application samples, Web service samples
    or Web service &amp; Web application samples. If the samples are not already installed, clicking on
    these links will install them. The relevant artifacts in the samples will take a few seconds to
    deploy, so you will have to wait for a while before checking out the Web service or Web application
    list.
