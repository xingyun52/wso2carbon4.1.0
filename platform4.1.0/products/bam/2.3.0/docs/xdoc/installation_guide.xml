<h3 id="Setting">Setting up the Environment and Tools </h3>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Maven:</strong> </p>

<p>The WSO2 Business Activity Monitor build is based on <a
href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a>. Hence, it is a prerequisite
to have Maven (version 2.1.0 or later) and JDK (version 1.6.0_21 or later) installed in
order to build WSO2 Business Activity Monitor from the source distribution. Extensive
instructions on Maven builds are available on the Maven site. </p>

<p>Please refer to the <a
href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html">Maven
Getting Started Guide</a> for more information on Maven </p>
<ul>
  <li>Unix based OS (e.g., Linux) </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Download Apache Maven tar ball or the zip archive. </li>
  <li>Expand it to a directory of choice. </li>
  <li>Set the environment variable MAVEN_HOME and add MAVEN_HOME/bin to the
    path as well. </li>
  <li>Refer to more instructions on how to install Maven in Unix based
    operating systems. </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>MS Windows </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Download and run the Apache Maven Windows installer package. </li>
  <li>Set the 'Environment Variables' (create the system variable MAVEN_HOME
    and edit the path. e.g., "C:\Program Files\Apache Software
    Foundation\maven-2.1.0"; path %MAVEN_HOME%\bin) </li>
  <li>Make sure that the system variable JAVA_HOME is set to the location of
    your JDK, e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6 </li>
  <li>Run mvn --version to verify that it is correctly installed. </li>
</ol>

<p>Once Maven is properly installed, you can start building the WSO2
Registry. </p>

<h3 id="Building1">Building WSO2 Business Activity Monitor </h3>
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://wso2.org/downloads/bam/">Download</a> the
    source distribution, which is available as a zip archive. </li>
  <li>Expand the source archive to a directory of your choice. </li>
  <li>All the necessary build scripts are included with the source
    distribution. </li>
  <li>You can run the following command inside that directory to build the
    WSO2 Business Activity Monitor. You will need a connection to the Internet for the Maven
    build to download dependencies required for the build. 
    <p><strong>mvn clean install</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This will create the complete release artifacts including the binary and
source distributions in the modules/distribution/target/ directory which can
be installed using the above instructions. </p>

<p>Note: The first time you run Maven it will automatically download the
dependent .jar files. Therefore, the first run will take more time. </p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="samples"><a id="Running">Running Samples</a></h2>

<p></p>

<p>WSO2 Business Activity Monitor samples are available at BAM_HOME/samples directory. The
instructions to run sample are given in README file of the respective
samples.</p>
