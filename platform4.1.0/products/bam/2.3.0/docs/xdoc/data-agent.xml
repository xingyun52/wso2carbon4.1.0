        <h1>Data Agents</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <b>NOTE: Publicly available data agents compatible with WSO2 products will only
                be available after the WSO2 BAM GA Release, it is not available in the 2.0.0-alpha version</b>
            The data agents are a set of clients that can be installed on to WSO2 products
            and used to pump various kinds of events into WSO2 BAM. This page will list all
            configuration options available for the data agents. If you are interested in
            integrating a custom data agent, please refer <a href="agent-api.html">Agent - API</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Transports</h2>
        <p>
            There are two transports available. The preferred is the Socket protocol that in
            native to Thrift. The default Thrift port is 7611. This can be changed by editing
            the corresponding value in the bam.xml file located at $BAM_HOME/repository/conf.

        </p>
        <h2>URL and Credentials</h2>
        <p>
            The URL value will be the BAM url that the BAM server is started on. This usually
            defaults to "https://localhost:9443/", if you are pointing to a BAM started in the
            same machine. Please adjust accordingly if you have modified the port offset. The
            port is needed here, for authentication purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The credentials usually default to "admin", "admin" for the username and password
            respectively. These credentials should have the permission to publish into the
            BAM server.

        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <p>
            Additional constant properties can be defined to be published with every event.
            This is particularly useful in some usecases where we need some unique
            identifier to recognize the particular client. Refer the cluster monitor sample
            for an extensive use case of this. Using UI, any number of properties can be
            defined to be published with every event.
