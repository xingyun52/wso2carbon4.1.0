        <h1>Installing Data Agents</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            There a pre-built set of data agents that are released as installable features
            with every release of BAM. The following steps will show you how to install these
            pre-built data agents. If you want to write a custom data agent have a look at the <a href="agent-api.html">agent-api.</a>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Adding the feature repo</li></h3>

            <p>
                To install the data agent features. First you need to add a repository.
            </p>

            <p>
                First click on "Features" under the Configure menu on your left. Click on the
                "Repository Management" tab, and click on "Add Repository".
            </p>

            <p>
            Afterwards, you need to enter the repository details. The repository can exist online (default location : <a
                href="http://dist.wso2.org/p2/carbon/releases/3.2.4">http://dist.wso2.org/p2/carbon/releases/3.2.4</a>
            or locally if you have downloaded a feature repository. Enter an arbitary name
            for the repository and the location of the repository.

            </p>

            <p>
            Now, when you click 'Add', if the details are correct the repository should
            appear as shown below.

            <h3><li>Locating the needed features</li></h3>

            <p>
                To locate the needed feature, on the same page, click on 'Available Features'.
                Select the repository that you added. Now searching will help you to narrow down
                the features. To install the BAM Agents search for a term such as "agent" or "BAM".
                Now, you will see some agent features. In these, the BAM Service Agent and BAM
                Mediation Agent will be of interest for most users. Select the one you need and click
                Install.


            </p>

            <h3><li>Clarifying whether the feature was installed correctly</li></h3>

            <p>
                If you installed, a feature aggregate, most probably a new menu item would
                have appeared <b>after you have restarted the server.</b> In the screen shot
                below, the UI for the Server Agent is shown after you have installed that
                feature.
