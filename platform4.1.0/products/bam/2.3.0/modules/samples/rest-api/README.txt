Running the REST Sample
=======================

Pre-requisites : You need to have curl installed and available to the command line path. Curl
can be downloaded from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html

1. Start the WSO2 BAM Server.

2. Go to $WSO2_BAM_HOME/samples/rest-api directory via console

3. Execute the rest-api.sh script with the command: ./rest-api.sh (on *nix systems) or rest-api.bat (on Windows systems)

4. You will see self explanatory logs as the sample is executed.

5. Look at the rest-api.sh or rest-api.bat to take a look at the curl commands that are taking place.
