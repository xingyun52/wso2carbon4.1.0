<h2>About WSO2 Carbon </h2>

<p>WSO2 Carbon is a component based Enterprise SOA platform. The
    design of
    WSO2 Carbon focuses on separating the key functionality of the SOA
    platform
    into separate pluggable Carbon components that can be mixed and
    matched, like
    customizable building blocks. This allows you to add only the
    functionality
    you need to start up, and continue to add product capabilities
    as your
    requirements grow. This helps a business to quickly adapt to
    changes.</p>

<p>OSGi is used as the underlying core modularization technology
    to build the
    Carbon platform. The Carbon framework is shipped with Eclipse Equinox
    by
    default, but can be supported on Spring dm Server, Felix or Knoplerfish
    if
    required. The OSGi technology even allows you to write your business
    functionality as an OSGi component and deploy it in the existing Carbon
    platform. </p>

<p> For a quick start on using the WSO2 Carbon
    platform, the Carbon components are pre-assembled into the following
    products: </p>
<ul id="CarbonProducts">
    <li><a href="http://wso2.com/products/governance-registry/">WSO2
        Governance Registry</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://wso2.com/products/application-server/">WSO2
        Application Server</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://wso2.com/products/business-rules-server/">WSO2
        Business Rules Server</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://wso2.com/products/business-process-server/">WSO2
        Business Process Server</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://wso2.com/products/identity-server/">WSO2
        Identity Server</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://wso2.com/products/data-services-server">WSO2
        Data Services Server</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://wso2.com/products/business-activity-monitor/">WSO2
        Business Activity Monitor</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://wso2.com/products/gadget-server/">WSO2
        Gadget Server</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can assemble your own products by combining
    components and
    deploying them in a preferred architecture. </p>

<p>The WSO2 Carbon platform gives maximum flexibility to adapt
    the middleware
    to your enterprise architecture, rather than adapt your architecture to
    the
    middleware. </p>
