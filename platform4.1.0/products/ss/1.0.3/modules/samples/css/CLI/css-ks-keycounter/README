Hector Cassandra Sample
------------------------------

This sample is used to calculate the number of keys in a given column family which is located in a user defined keyspace.


Build the project with Maven build too using following command

	mvn clean install

Build the project with dependency libraries using following maven build command

	mvn clean assembly:assembly

Execute the build jar which is located under target folder by passing command line arguments as follows.


    java -jar target/KeyCounter-4.0.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar tenantName tenantPassword hostPool keyspace columnFamily

    tenantName-Username of the tenant
    tenantPassword-Password of the tenant
    hostPool:Cassandra host pool each host and port separated by commas.
    keyspace:Cassandra keyspace which contains the column family  where user need to get the key count
    ColumnFamily:Column family name which user need to know the available key count

    Eg:

    Input:

    java -jar target/KeyCounter-4.0.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar admin admin localhost:9160 test_keyspace test_columnFamily
