User can specify cassandra host and the port of the cassandra server to get the connection. Leaving both of host and port cause to connect to the local cassandra server available in the
user local machine.

User need to specify the username and a password to authenticate to cassandra. If user using Storage Server user need to specify super tenant or the tenant username and the password.
