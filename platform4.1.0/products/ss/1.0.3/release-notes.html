<h1>The WSO2 Storage Server (WSO2 SS) 1.0.3 Released!</h1>

<p>
    The WSO2 Storage Server team is pleased to announce the release of version 1.0.3 of
    the Open Source Storage Server (WSO2 SS).
</p>

<p>
    WSO2 Storage Server is user friendly interface for multi-tenant relational storage, Column storage
    and Hadoop Distribution Filesystem.
    Storage Server (WSO2 SS) distributed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache
    Software License v2.0</a>. WSO2 SS allows system administrators and developers to
    easily create and mange Relational databases, Column stores and data on a HDFS file system.
</p>

<p>
    WSO2 SS 1.0.3 is developed on top of the revolutionary
    <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a> (Middleware a' la carte),
    an OSGi based framework that provides seamless modularity to your SOA via
    componentization. This release also contains many new features and a range of optional
    components (add-ons) that can be installed to customize the behavior of the SS. Further, any
    existing features of the SS which are not required to your environment can be easily
    removed using the underlying provisioning framework of Carbon. In brief, WSO2 SS can
    be fully customized and tailored to meet your exact Storage and SOA needs.
