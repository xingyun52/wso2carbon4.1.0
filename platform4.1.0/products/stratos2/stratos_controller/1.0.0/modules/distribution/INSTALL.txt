System Requirements
===================
1. Minimum memory - 1 GB
2. Processor      - Pentium 800MHz or equivalent at minimum
3. JDK - 1.6.x (1.6.0_24 onwards recommended for production)
4. The Management Console requires you to enable Javascript of the Web browser,
   with MS IE 6 and 7. In addition to JavaScript, ActiveX should also be enabled
   with IE. This can be achieved by setting your security level to
   medium or lower.
   NOTE:
     On Windows Server 2003, it is not allowed to go below the medium security
     level in Internet Explorer 6.x and the default medium security setting with
     IE does not allow sufficient level of JS or ActiveX enablement for the
     management console to run.
