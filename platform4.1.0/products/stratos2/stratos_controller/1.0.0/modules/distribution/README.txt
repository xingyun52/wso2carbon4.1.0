WSO2 Stratos 
------------

Welcome to the WSO2 Stratos

WSO2 Stratos is a complete cloud middleware platform for implementing an enterprise service-oriented 
architecture (SOA). WSO2 Stratos is open source and is available under Apache license. It is built on 
top of and extends WSO2 Carbon, the award-winning, comprehensive, concise, lean enterprise middleware
platform.

With WSO2 Stratos, IT professionals have a fully hosted platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for rapidly 
building and deploying services and composite applications, with instant provisioning capability. 
WSO2 Stratos delivers on the promise of cloud computing with a complete, enterprise middleware 
platform for delivering applications that can run on, and integrate with, any combination of private 
clouds, public clouds and on-premise systems. WSO2 Stratos is equipped with features for auto-scaling 
and single sign-on, as well as enhanced functionality for automatic activity monitoring, usage metering, 
and centralized governance and identity management.

WSO2 Stratos offers all the benefits of the cloud without the complexity or fear of vendor lock-in.
    * WSO2 Stratos is integrated across multiple middleware platform services and provides unified 
         interfaces across services; hence facilitate shorter project times.
    * Metering reduce costs by allowing monitoring that lead to optimizing data center utilization 
         and allowing companies to pay only for what they use.
    * Auto-scaling provides the ability to scale up or down based on the demand for services and usage 
         capacity, eliminating both resource starvation as well as resource slack.
    * Multi-tenancy means applications supporting different organizations, business units or regional 
         offices can be delivered cost-effectively from a single location sharing the same platform and 
         resources, yet run fully independently.
    * Built-in automated governance and centralized identity management facilitates control over 
         applications and services across different tenants.
    * WSO2 Stratos is based on the comprehensive WSO2 Carbon middleware platform, hence, applications 
         can be migrated smoothly and safely on premise, to a private cloud, to the public cloud, or to a 
         hybrid environment.providing unprecedented deployment flexibility.

WSO2 Stratos comes with all of the production-quality runtime engines in WSO2 Carbon available as cloud services:
    * WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus as a Service
    * WSO2 Application Server as a Service
    * WSO2 Data as a Service
    * WSO2 Governance as a Service
    * WSO2 Identity as a Service
    * WSO2 Business Activity Monitoring as a Service
    * WSO2 Business Processes as a Service
    * WSO2 Business Rules as a Service
    * WSO2 Gadgets as a Service
    * WSO2 Complex Event Processing as a Service
    * WSO2 Message Broker as a Service 

WSO2 Stratos Features
---------------------

At the heart of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service is a cloud manager. This PaaS home service provides 
management and monitoring capabilities and offers a Web portal where users can register their domains (tenants), 
log in, manage their accounts, manage users and roles, and activate/deactivate the middleware services that 
are available for their users.

The PaaS home offers point-and-click simplicity for provisioning middleware services, so developers can 
get started immediately and focus on the business logic, rather than configuring and deploying software systems.

The platform integration layer within WSO2 Stratos allows it to install onto any existing cloud infrastructure 
such as Eucalyptus, Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud, Amazon EC2, and VMware ESX. Enterprises are never locked into a 
specific infrastructure provider or platform.

Once WSO2 Stratos is installed, a Web-based management portal lets users configure, manage and govern 
independent-but-consistent services for each department, or for each stage of a system's lifecycle. 
Each server is completely virtual, scaling up automatically to handle the required load, and metered and 
billed according to use.

Noteworthy WSO2 Stratos features include:
    * Auto-scaling capabilities.
        WSO2 Stratos automatically adjusts the use of cloud resources to meet increased or decreased demand.
    * Single sign-on functionality.
        Users only need to sign on once to access all WSO2 Stratos services that they are authorized to use.
    * Enhanced automatic activity monitoring.
        Activity monitoring is available in real time, so there is no time gap between data collection and 
        the availability of data for monitoring.
    * Enhanced usage metering.
        Metering is automated so that every operation by tenant users will be monitored and recorded. 
        The metering information can be used for billing and for offering constrained access for certain services.
	* Tenant aware logging
		Tenants can view their logs in order to monitor the status of the deployed services
		of and applications. It is also helpful for debugging purposes.
    * Enhanced centralized governance and identity management.
        All the resources of all Stratos services can be monitored and governed from a single point - from WSO2 
        Stratos governance. When a modification, such as changing a security policy, or changing the keystore, 
        is done from a single place, it is immediately visible to all other services. In addition to that, 
        all services share a single user store. When a user is added from a service, that new user can immediately 
        access all other services available for the tenant.
