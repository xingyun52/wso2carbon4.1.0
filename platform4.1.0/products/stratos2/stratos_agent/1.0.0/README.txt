================================================================================

Welcome to the WSO2 Elastic Load Balancer 2.0.3 release

WSO2 ELB is a lightweight and easy-to-use Open Source Elastic Load Balancer
(ELB) available under the Apache Software License v2.0. WSO2 ELB allows
administrators to simply configure message load balancing, failover routing,
and auto scaling. The runtime has been designed to be completely
asynchronous, non-blocking and streaming based on the Apache Synapse core.

This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon [Middleware a' la carte]
framework. All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon
components. WSO2 Elastic Load Balancer is a compact version doing the load balancing
features of WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus.


Key Features of WSO2 ELB
========================

1. Non-blocking HTTP/S transports based on Apache HttpCore for ultra fast
   execution and support for thousands of connections at high concurrency with
   constant memory usage. Integrated high performing, Passthrough Transport. 
2. Load-balancing (with or without sticky sessions)/Fail-over, and clustered
   Throttling and Caching support.
3. Automatically scaling the system according to the number of requests in-flight for
   a particular service cluster - "Scale up early, scale down slowly".
4. Service aware dynamic load balancing - A single load balancer
   can centrally manage the load across the nodes of different service clusters.
5. Tenant aware load balancing - Tenants can be loaded and unloaded dynamically.
   Tenants can be partitioned to different service clusters.
6. Lightweight, XML and Web services centric messaging model.
7. Administrator friendly - Configurations are simple and easy.

1. Minimum memory - 1.5GB
2. Processor      - Pentium 800MHz or equivalent at minimum
