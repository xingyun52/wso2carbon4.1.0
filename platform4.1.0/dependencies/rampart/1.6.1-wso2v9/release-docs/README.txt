Installation
============

Using Ant
---------
Run ant script on extracted binary distribution and it will copy the required files to Axis2. You have to set the AXIS2_HOME system variable to point to your Axis2 binary distribution. 

Manual Installation
-------------------
You can copy the required libraries and module files manually. You need copy all the libraries in the lib directory of Rampart binary distribution to Axis2 lib directory and all the module files to in the modules directory of  Rampart binary distribution to Axis2 modules directory. 

Axis2 lib directory – AXIS2_HOME/lib (Standard binary distribution ) or axis2/WEB-INF/lib (WAR)

Axis2 modules directory – AXIS2_HOME/repository/modules (Standard binary distribution ) or axis2/WEB-INF/modules (WAR)


IMPORTANT: 
Before you build rampart from source distribution, you need provision for 
unlimited security jurisdiction as some of the test cases use key size of
256. So you need to download jce_policy-x_y_z.zip (relevant to your JDK version)
and replace the old jar files (local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar) in 
$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security. These files are listed in sun download site,
under the your JDK version as Java(TM) Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited 
Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.     

Bouncy castle jars are no longer shipped with Rampart binary distribution
due some patent issues.But as bouncy castle jars are necessary for Rampart, users 
will have to manually download and copy the bouncy castle jar corresponding the
relevant JDK. Bouncy castle jars can be downloaded from 
http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html 

Adding bouncycastle as a security provider 

1.) Download bouncycastle according to your java version. You can download 
bouncycastle from the following link.
http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html
2.) Add the bcprov-jdkXX-139.jar to your service's / client's classpath. 
3.) Add the following line to java.security file which can be found in JRE's 
lib/security directory as the last line.
security.provider.X=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider

Test cases written for SAML 2.0 support requires endorsing the JDK's default JAXP 
implementation with Xerces(http://xerces.apache.org/mirrors.cgi#binary) and 
Xalan(http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/downloads.html#latest-release). So before building Rampart from the
source distribution, you need to copy resolver-x.x.x.jar, serializer-x.x.x.jar, xercesImpl-x.x.x.jar 
and xml-apis-x.x.x.jar from the Xerces binary distribution and xalan-x.x.x.jar from the xalan binary 
distribution to the endorsed directory. If you are using Sun JDK, endorsed directory is located at 
$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/endorsed.

When Rampart is deployed in a particular application server, please refer to the endorsing mechanism 
recommended for that server and endorse the JAXP implementation using the set of jars mentioned above. 

Before you try any of the samples make sure you

1.) Have the Axis2 standard binary distribution downloaded and extracted.
2.) Set the AXIS2_HOME environment variable
3.) Run ant from the "samples" directory to copy the required libraries and
    modules to relevant directories in AXIS2_HOME.

   software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
   algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation
   distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception
   ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS 
   Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object
