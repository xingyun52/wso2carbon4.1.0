Step5: Add the key store information by adding the following into the Connector element in server.xml.

truststoreFile="rampart-sample-keys.jks"
truststorePass="apache"
truststoreType="JKS"
keystoreFile="rampart-sample-keys.jks"
keystorePass="apache"

Start tomcat and check the service by typing "https://127.0.0.1:8443/axis2/services/listServices" in the browser. If you have changed the SSL port then type the correct port number and please change the build.xml's ssl.port accordingly.
