<h1>Reliable Messaging</h1>

<p>The goal of Reliable Messaging in Web services is to allow applications to
send and receive messages in an efficient, and reliable manner
amidst application, platform, or network failure. The WS-Reliable Messaging
specification (WS-RM), defines a protocol and a set of mechanisms that ensure
that messages are delivered reliably between two endpoints.</p>

<p>The WSO2 Web Services Application Server (WSAS) provides a Reliable
Messaging tool that is used to enable WS-RM to services at global level and service level. If
you activate reliable messaging for a particular service, your configurations
will be applied to that particular service. WS-Reliable Messaging handles and
solves both simple and complex scenarios arising in message transmission.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Enabling Reliable Messaging</h2>
<p><strong>Service Level</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the navigator, under Manage/Services, click <strong>List</strong>.
    The <em><strong>Deployed Services</strong></em> page appears. </li>
  <li>Click the service for which you want to activate reliable messaging.
    The <em><strong>Service Dashboard</strong></em> page appears. </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Reliable Messaging</strong> in the Quality of Service
    Configuration panel. The <em><strong>Enable Reliable
    Messaging</strong></em> page appears.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Enable Reliable Messaging</strong> list, click
    <strong>Yes</strong>.
    The current reliable messaging configuration appears.</li>
  <li>Modify the configuration if required.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.
    Reliable messaging will be activated for that particular service.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Global Level</strong></p>

<p>In the navigator, under Manage/Modules, click click <strong>List</strong>.
    This will show you all the deployed modules. Then click <strong>Configure</strong> link
    in front of sandesha2 module. Then you can configure reliable meassaging in the same
    way as explained above.</p>

<h2><a name="Sequence" id="Sequence">RM Sequence Configuration
Parameters</a></h2>

<p>WS-RM defines a one way sequence. The sender (source) is called the RMS
(reliable messaging source) and the receiver (destination) is called the RMD
(reliable messaging destination). Therefore for in-out operations, the RM
uses two sequences. For request messages, the server acts as the RMD and for
response messages, the server act as the RMS.</p>

<table style="width: 100%;" border="1">

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Inactivity Timeout Interval </strong></td>
      <td>The maximum inactive time for any RM session. After the sequence
        timeout, the RM session is terminated.</td>
