<h1>Switch Default Mediator</h1>
<p>
The Switch Default Mediator will be a child mediator for the Switch Mediator. It is to define a defalut case for the
current routing switch. If all the cases were not matched with the switch value, the sequence defined as children to the
default mediator will be taken as the route of the message.
