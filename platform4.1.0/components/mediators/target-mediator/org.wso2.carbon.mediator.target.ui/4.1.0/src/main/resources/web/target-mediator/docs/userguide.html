<h1>Target Mediator</h1>
<p>
The Target Mediator can be used to form a new SOAP message from an existing SOAP info-set. Here you can specify either
an endpoint from the registry or a sequence of named or anonymous mediators to direct the message.
</p>

<p>
Here you can prepare a message to send to an endpoint or mediate through some more sequences.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
SOAP Action: The SOAP action of the message.
</li>
<li>
To Address: Then target endpoint address.
</li>
<li>
Sequence: Mediate the message through a sequence. You can either pick a named sequence from the registry or define an 
anonymous sequence by adding mediators to the current Target mediator as children.
</li>
<li>
Endpoint: Send the message to an endpoint. Here you can pick a named endpoint from the registry (which you can add in the Endpoint panel
that can be accessed from the Manage-&gt; Mediation-&gt; Endpoints menu in the left hand side menu bar.) or keep the endpoint as anonymous.
</li>
</ul>
