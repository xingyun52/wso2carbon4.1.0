<h1>Router Mediator</h1>
<p>
The Router mediator can be used to specify the routing of the message according to given conditions. This is very 
similar the Switch mediator. But unlike switch mediator which choose define routes based on matching different regular expression for the same
xpath expression (like 'switch' operator in Java), the router mediator can be used to define routes to completely different 
expressions in a nested fashion. (like if-else-if operator in Java)
