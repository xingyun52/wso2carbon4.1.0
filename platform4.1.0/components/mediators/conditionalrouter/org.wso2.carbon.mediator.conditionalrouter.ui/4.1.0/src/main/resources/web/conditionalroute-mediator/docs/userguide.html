<h1>Conditional Router Mediator</h1>

<p>
The Conditional  Router mediator can be used to specify the routing of the message according to given conditions. Mediator checks whether the<br/>
 'Condition' evaluates to true and mediates using the target sequence.
 Matching route will break the router if the 'Break after route' is set to true.
