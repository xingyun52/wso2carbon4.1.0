<h1>Clone Mediator</h1>
<p>
The clone mediator closely resembles the Message Splitter EIP and will
split the message into number of identical messages which will be
processed in parallel. They can also be set to process sequentially using
the optional 'sequential' attribute.
</p>
<p>

<h3>Clone mediator field descriptions</h3>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Clone ID - This can be used to identify messages created by this clone mediator. This is particularly
useful when aggregating responses of messages that are created using nested iterate mediators.
</li>
<li>
Sequential Mediation - If "Yes" created messages will be processed sequentially, otherwise they will
be processed in parallel.
</li>
<li>Continue Parent - If "Yes" the original message will be
continued. If "No" the original message will be dropped.</li>
<li>Number of clones - Number of clones created. This can be
controlled by adding one or more clone targets by clicking <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Clone Target</span>.
Figure 3 shows the screen after clicking <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Clone Target</span>. Targets can then have it's own set of mediators.</li>
</ul>
