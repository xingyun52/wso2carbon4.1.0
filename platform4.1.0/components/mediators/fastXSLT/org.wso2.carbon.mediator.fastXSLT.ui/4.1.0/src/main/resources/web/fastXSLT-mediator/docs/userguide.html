<h1>XSLT Mediator</h1>

<p>
    The fastXSLT mediator applies the specified XSLT transformation to the selected element of the current
    message payload. If the source element is not specified, it defaults to the first child of the soap
    body. Optionally parameters (XSLT) could be passed into the transformations through the 'property'
    field. The 'feature' field defines any features which should be explicitly set to the TransformerFactory.
    The feature 'http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse/transform/feature/dom' turns on DOM based transformations instead
    of serializing elements into Byte streams and/or temporary files. Though this would be better in
    performance than using byte streams, sometimes it may not work for all transformations.

<ul>
    <li>
        Key : The registry key to refer the xslt.
    </li>
    <li>
        Source: Specify in which part of message (specified in xpath) the xslt should be applied. Default is the SOAP
