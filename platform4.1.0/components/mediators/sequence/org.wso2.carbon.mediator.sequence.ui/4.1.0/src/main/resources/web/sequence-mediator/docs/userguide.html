<p><strong>Figure1: Sequence Mediator</strong></p>

<p>
In the Sequence Mediator panel, there are two options available to select a sequence.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Static way 	:- In staic manner, User can provide a registry key which refers a predefined sequence</li>
    <li>Dynamic way :- Where user can define a 'XPath' expression to point the exact sequence name, which <br/>
					   is present in the message. So, ESB will look into the system for that particular sequence and will do further processing. </li>
