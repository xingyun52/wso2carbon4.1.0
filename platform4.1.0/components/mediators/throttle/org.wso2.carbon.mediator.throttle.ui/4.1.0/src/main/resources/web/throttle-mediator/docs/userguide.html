<h1>Throttle Mediator</h1>
<p>
The Throttle mediator can be used for rate limiting as well as concurrency based limiting. A WS-Policy 
dictates the throttling configuration and may be specified inline or loaded from the registry. The Throttle 
mediator could be added in the request path for rate limiting and concurrent access limitation. When using 
for concurrent access limitation, the same throttle mediator 'id' must be triggered on the response flow 
so that completed responses are deducted from the available limit. (i.e. two instances of the throttle mediator 
with the same 'id' attribute in the request and response flows). The 'onReject' and 'onAccept' sequence references 
or inline sequences define how accepted and rejected messages are to be handled
