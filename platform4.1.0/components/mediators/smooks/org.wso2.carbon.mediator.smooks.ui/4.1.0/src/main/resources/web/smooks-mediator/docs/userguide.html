	<h1>Smooks Mediator</h1>

	<p>
		Smooks mediator can be used to apply lightweight transformations on messages in an efficient manner.
		Smooks is a powerful framework for processing, manipulating and transforming XML. More information
		about Smooks can be obtained from the official <a href="http://www.smooks.org">Smooks website</a>.

	<p><strong>Smooks Mediator Configuartion</strong></p>

	<p>
		The Smooks mediator requires the transformation definition to be passed in as an external resource.
		This transformation can be specified as a local entry or be stored in the registry. The mediator UI
		enables you to point the mediator to an existing local entry or a registry resource.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Input</h2>
	
	<p>
		User can define an 'input' as a 'Text' or 'XML' and need to provide a 'xpath' expression to pick exact <br/>
		message block, else by default whole 'message body' will be selected by default.
	</p>

	<h2>Output</h2>
	<p>
		Same like in  input, user can define how his output should be. When user defines an 'output' expression there are<br/>
		additional operations can be performed.
	</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Add     : Selected node will be added as a child to the message.
			</li>
			<li>
				Replace : Selected node will be replaced in the message.
			</li>
			<li>
				Sibling : Selected node will be added as a sibling.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
	<p>
	When user defines an 'output' as a 'Property', property will be saved in the messagecontext for the future uses.
