<h1>Toolbox</h1>

<p>A toolbox is an installable archive, with a .tbox extension. A toolbox will contains necessary artifacts that models
    a complete use case. A toolbox can contain the below artifacts </p>
<ol>
    <li>Stream definitions</li>
    <li>Analytics</li>
    <li>Dashboard components</li>
</ol>

<p>All three artifacts are not mandated, and they are optional. You can have all of three artifacts or either of them in
    one toolbox. And only those artifcats will be deployed.</p>

<p>Stream Definitions, are the definitions of the streams of data which you are going to send to WSO2 BAM and perform
    the analytics.You can place any number of stream definitions under one toolbox and all of then will be deployed with
    that toolbox. But Each stream definitions need to be in the separate file. You can find More details on how to
    create the stream definition artifact on Creating a custom toolbox.</p>

<p>Analytics, includes the hive scripts which you are going to deploy in WSO2 BAM. Similar to the stream definitions
    artifact you can place any number of analytic scripts and ll of the will be deployed. You can provide the cron
    expression if you want to schedule the analytic script for each script in a seperate properties file. You can find
    More details on how to create the analytic scripts on Creating a custom toolbox.</p>

<p>Dashboard components, contains the gadget xmls, jaggery files, etc. You can specify the number of tabs, title of
    tabs, gadgets that should be shown in a tab, etc in a properties file, and the dashboard will be organised as
    specified. You can find More details on how to create the dashboard components on Creating a custom toolbox.</p>

<p>For example, to monitor service statistics of service hosting WSO2 servers the stream definitions, analyzers and
    dashboard components needed will be available in the "Service Stats" toolbox. So, by installing the "Service Stats"
    toolbox, all artifacts will be deployed to the necessary locations in the server. Then, when data from a "Service
    Stats Data Agent" reaches BAM, after a few minutes you will see the Service Stats dashboard populated with service
    statistics.</p>
