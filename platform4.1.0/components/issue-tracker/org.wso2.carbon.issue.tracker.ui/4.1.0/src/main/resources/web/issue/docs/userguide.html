        The Issue Tracker tool enables StratosLive users to obtain support services for solving issues they encounter
        while consuming StratosLive services. Tenants with Demo accounts are eligible to obtain our free support service
        via StratosLive forum and are able to experience our comprehensive support service by upgrading their account to
        paid accounts.
    </p>

    <h2>Support User Registration Process</h2>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        In order to report an issue you need to be first registered as a WSO2 Oxygen Tank (OT) member and associate your
        OT account with WSO2 Support service.
    </p>

    <li><h3>Registering an OT account </h3></li>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        Go to Tools -> Issue Tracker -> Accounts -> Add new account

        Here you can either create a new OT account and associate it with the support service. If you already have an
        existing account it is quite possible to associate the existing account with the support service as well.
    </p>

    <li><h3>Reporting Issues</h3></li>
    <br/>

    <p align="left">

        whenever you are encountered an issue or got something to clarify you are encouraged to report us. Users with
        Demo accounts in StratosLive are eligible to obtain our free support service via StratosLive forum. Users with
        paid accounts in StratosLive are exposed to more comprehensive support service and eligible to report and
        co-ordinate through JIRA.

        To report an issue go to Tools -> Issue Tracker -> Issues -> Add

        A link to the Forum will be displayed to Demo account holders and the following page will be displayed to other
        paid account holders.

        Provide issue details, attach the required attachments and click create button.

        Environment details about the service will be automatically captured and reported to the JIRA along with the
        issue.

    </p>

    <h3>Attachments</h3>

    <p style="text-align: left;">

        Users can attach attachments to the issue. Additionally super admin is given the opportunity
        to attach a thread dump, bundle.info file and log file to the issue.

    </p>

    <li><h3>View Issues</h3></li>

    <p style="text-align: left;">

        Users can view details of issues reported to JIRA by them selves. For a tenant who changed his subscription from
        a paid to Demo, issues reported previously while holding the paid subscription are visible in a read only view.

        To view reported issues go to Tools -> Issue Tracker -> Issues -> List
