    <h1>Cloud GateWay - User Guide</h1>
    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This is the user guide for <a href="http://wso2.com/cloud/connectors/services-gateway/">
        Cloud GateWay</a>. If you read this document that means you have successfully
        installed the CG Agent component.

        Cloud GateWay(CG) is consist of two parts.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>CG Agent - This feature let you to add/edit CG servers and publish/unpublished services
         to a remote CG server. This feature should be installed in the service hosting product
            (WSO2 Application server for example). </li>
        <li>CG Server - This is the server component which holds the public service for published
        services. This comes either as a stand alone product of as a service for cloud deployments.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="what-does">What does Cloud Gateway(CG) do?</h2>
    <p>Most of the corporate networks in today's world are secured with corporate firewalls. There
         are services deployed in the private network that can only access within the organization. If you
        want to access one of these services from your home, you'll not be able to do that because of the
        firewall. In such time CG can come to rescue you.
    </p>
    <p>
       When a private service is published a public proxy will be deployed on CG server which acts as the front end
        for the private service. This minimal proxy has a very specific feature. The proxy will have an
        endpoint on a server(which is based on Apache Thrift) which holds the incoming messages. In turns the private
        service (when published) starts to poll the endpoint on the  Thrift server. This queue
        is used the as the communication medium for the front end proxy and the back end private
        service. The server that holds message on behalf of the private service is bundle into the CG server.
    </p>
    <p>
        The technique that we have used to publish a private to public is very simple. When you are within the
        firewall you can access the outside but not from outside to inside. When you publish a private service
        that service will act as the client and will always make the connection to internet from inside the corporate
        firewall. Since the firewall allows connection from inside to outside we'll not face any problem publishing
        services and using them outside. Once published, a proxy service will be deployed on ESB which you can use as the
        public service. At runtime messages will flow in the same path.</p>

    <p> The deploying proxy will have the same name as the private service.</p>

    <h2 id="deployment">Deployment of CG</h2>
    <p>When deploying CG the private services which will be hosted on one of the service hosting products
    (such as AS, BPS, BRS, MS etc..) and will be deployed behind the corporate firewall. The CG server
    will be deployed in a place where publicly accessible.</p>

    <p><img alt="" src="images/csg-deployment.png" height="769" width="876"/></p>
    <p>Figure 1: The deployment diagram for CG deployment.</p>

    <h2 id="use-case">Use case of CG</h2>
    <p>CG can be used to expose a private service to public through a corporate firewall.</p>
    
    <h2 id="default-user">Default CG user</h2>
    <p>CG server has a default user, 'cguser' (without quotes) which can be used to publish a
    service. 'cguser'(with password wso2@123, see CG server documentation to see how to 
    change the password) can be used instead of the admin user with all permissions.</p>

    <h2 id="add-server">Adding a new CG server</h2>
    <p>To add a new CG server just login into one of the service hosing servers( from this point onwards WSO2 Application Server-AS, will
        be used) you can add a new CG server
    by using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CG Agent</span> link from the left menu of the console under Configure section.
    This will forward you to the UI to add new CG server or publish a service wizard.</p>
    <p><img alt="" src="images/add-server-pub-service.png" height="220" width="815"/></p>
    <p>Figure 2: Add server or publish a service</p>

    <p>Select the Add/Edit CG server option to add a new CG server. This will display the new CG server add wizard.</p>
    <p><img alt="" src="images/add-server.png" height="290" width="1067"/></p>
    <p>Figure 3: Add/Edit server</p>

    <p>Each of the field has the following meaning. Note that all these fields are mandatory except Domain Name field.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">CG Server Name</span> - A logical name for the server so that later you can select the server to
            publish the service.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">CG Server URL</span> - The remote CG server URL. </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">User Name</span> - The user name of the remote CG server user. If the domain name is not given the user name will be only the provided username, otherwise
        it'll be 'user-name@domain-name'(for cloud deployments). By default a user called 'cguser' is used.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Password</span> - The password of the remote CG server user, ex - password of test@test.org.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once this server is added it'll list under the CG server listing page. This wizard can be
    use to edit the already added servers or to remove any servers.</p>
    <p><img src="images/server-list.png"  height="171" width="942"/></p>
    <p>Figure 4: List of added servers</p>

<h2 id="publish">Publishing options</h2>
<p>Once a server is added you can publish the already deployed services to those servers. Go to
home page of CG Agent and follow the link "Publish/Unpublish service". This will bring you to the
service publishing wizard.</p>
<p><img src="images/publish-service-1.png"  height="300" width="1054"/></p>
    <p>Figure 5: Publish service</p>
<p>Select the service that you want to publish and click on Publish link. This will you to the service publishing option wizard.</p>
    
<p><img src="images/publish-service-2.png" height="214" width="906"/></p>
<p>Figure 6: Select publishing options.</p>
    
<p>From the wizard you can select the mode and the server that you want to publish this
service. The drop down menu will list added CG serves set. When selecting the mode either you can use automatic or manual.
A public proxy service that was added using the automatic method will respond to its private service changes (service deleted)
and manual mode will not aware of any changes in private service changes. The default mode is automatic.</p>

<p>Once the service is published it's additional actions will be listed. An already published service can either
    Unpublish, Restart, Switch-To-Automatic(if manual mode was selected) or Switch-To-Manual(if automatic mode was
    selected). Also note that the Restart option is only available in manual mode because in automatic mode that is
    handle automatically.
</p>
<p>Once the private service is published, a use can view or try the CG service WSDL or using the try it tool.</p>

    <p><img src="images/publish-service-3.png" height="314" width="1515"/></p>
    <p>Figure 6: Other publishing options.</p>

<p>An unpublished service can be published again if required.</p>
    
<h2 id="roles">Users and publishing roles</h2>
<p>Any users can be assigned one of the two roles 'cg_publisher' and 'cg_unpublisher' roles to perform the
    mentioned actions. To add and/or edit a remote CG server users need to have admin role.</p>
 <p><img src="images/roles.png" height="266" width="1054"/></p>
 <p>Figure 7: CG specific roles for users.</p>

<h2 id="firewall">Configuring firewall rule for CG server</h2>
<p>
    Upon publishing a service it'll start to poll the remote CG server's message store infrastructure queue
    for any request messages. As you may aware CG server uses Apache Thrift based server implementation for
    storing any request messages. Since CG Agent side requires to access this Thrift based server the firewall
    has to enable for this server port(by default which runs on port 15001).
