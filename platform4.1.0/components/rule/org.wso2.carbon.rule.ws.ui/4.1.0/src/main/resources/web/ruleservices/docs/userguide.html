        rule script. In-lined, upload or as a registry key. Figure 3 shows how to
        give rule script as In-Lined.
        Rule set creation properties can be used to specify the different types of rule sources.
        For an example if the rule file is a decision table then user needs to add a property with
        the name 'source' and value 'javax.rules.admin.RuleExecutionSet.source.decisiontable'.
