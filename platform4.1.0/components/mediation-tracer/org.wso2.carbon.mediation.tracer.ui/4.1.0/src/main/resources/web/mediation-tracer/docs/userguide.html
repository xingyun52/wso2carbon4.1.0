<h1>Mediation Tracer</h1>
Traces the entire path when a message travels along a mediation sequence.To
see the trace messages, you have to enable tracing for a sequence.

<strong>Warning</strong>: Turning on the Tracer feature will have a drag on
the performance. This is because all the messages will always be completely
built (i.e., deferred building will not be done) and stored in the database
by WSO2 Data Services. Hence this option should be used with caution.



<h2>Enabling Tracing
</h2>
<ol><li> In the navigator, under Manage/Mediation, click
<strong>Sequences</strong>. The <em><strong>Mediation Sequences</strong></em>
page appears.</li> 
<li>Click <strong>Enable Tracing</strong>.When tracing is enabled, the
linkwill display Disable Tracing.</li></ol>
