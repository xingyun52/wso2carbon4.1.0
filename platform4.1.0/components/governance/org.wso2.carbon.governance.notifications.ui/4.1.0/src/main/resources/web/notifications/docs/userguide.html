<h1>Notifications</h1>

<p>The Notifications feature can be used to generate notifications for events that occur as
a result of performing operations. In order to receive notifications, users will have to
create a subscription to a particular event along with a specified notification method (which can be
an e-mail alert or a SOAP message). Each subscription is associated with a resource or collection on
the registry. The Manage Notifications page can be used to create, edit, or delete subscriptions to
notifications on various operations performed on resources and collections stored in the registry.
</p>


<h2>Managing Subscriptions</h2>

<p>If you currently have made any subscriptions, these will be listed in a table, and beneath it you
can click the link to add a new subscription.</p>

<p>Figure 1: Manage Notifications Page</p>

<p>If you currently have no subscriptions, a message indicating that you have not got any
subscriptions followed by the link to add a new subscription. On the table (seen in Figure 1 above),
you can click on the <strong>Path</strong> to browse the corresponding resource or collection. If
you have subscribed with the notification method <strong>User Profile</strong>, You can also browse
the user's default profile by clicking on the <strong>User Profile</strong> link under the
Notification tab.</p>


<h2>Adding Subscriptions to a Resource</h2>

<p>When you click on a link to add a new subscription you will be forwarded to a dedicated page
through which you can subscribe to notifications made on resources and collections of a single or
many types.</p>

<h2>Adding Subscriptions to a Collection</h2>

<p>
For Collections there is an additional facility of creating Hierarchical Subscriptions if needed. By default when a user
adds a subscription to a Collection it will only get added to that collection. Similarly the user can add a subscription
to that collection and its immediate child resources by selecting the option <strong>Collection and Children only</strong>
or to that collection and all of its child resources by selecting the option <strong>Collection,Children and Grand Children</strong>.</p>

<p>To start with, you have to specify the <strong>Subscription Path</strong>. To do so, you simply
need to click on the <strong>..</strong> button seen in Figure 2. This will open a
<strong>Resource Tree Browser</strong> as seen in Figure 3 below.</p>

<p>Figure 4: Resource Tree</p>

<p>Selecting the <strong>Subscription Path</strong> can be done by clicking on any of the listed
resources and collections, and pressing the <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>

<p>The next step in adding a subscription involves selecting the event type and the notification
method. The event types supported by default are as follows</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check LC Item   - Represents an event that fires when a item is checked in a lifecycle
  check-list.</li>
  <li>Uncheck LC Item - Represents an event that fires when a item is unchecked in a lifecycle
  check-list.</li>
  <li>Create Child    - Represents an event of creating a resource (or collection) within an
  existing collection.</li>
  <li>Delete Child    - Represents an event of deleting a resource (or collection) within an
  existing collection.</li>
  <li>Delete          - Represents an event of deleting a resource (or collection).</li>
  <li>Create LC       - Represents an event of creating a lifecycle.</li>
  <li>Delete LC       - Represents an event of deleting a lifecycle.</li>
  <li>Change LC State - Represents an event of changing a lifecycle state.</li>
  <li>Update          - Represents an event of updating a resource or collection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that some of these events may not be available for certain types resources and
collections. We support a variety of notification methods as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>E-mail             - Any valid e-mail address.</li>
  <li>REST               - An endpoint accepting HTML or text content.</li>
  <li>SOAP               - An endpoint accepting notifications as a SOAP message.</li>
  <li>User Profile       - A valid user's profile. Notifications will be sent to the e-mail address
  specified on the user's default profile.</li>
  <li>Group Profile      - A valid role. Notifications will be sent to all the users in the
  specified role.</li>
  <li>Management Console - A valid role. Notifications will be sent to work-list for role.</li>
  <li>JMX                - Notifications will be sent via JMX.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the notification method you select, you may be required to provide additional
information, such as the e-mail address to use of the name of the user of whom the profile will be
used. When using E-mail, User Profile or Group Profile is used you can also specify the
<b>Digest Frequency</b> as None, Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Fortnightly or Monthly.

    Having done this step, you will have to click on the <strong>Subscribe</strong> button to add
a subscription (see Figure 2 above).</p>

<p>
    You can also add new subscriptions to a resource/collection by browsing that resource/collection
    using the resource browser and clicking <b>Add Subscription</b> link in <b>Subscriptions</b> box
    that appears in the right hand side pane of the resource browser (Figure 3)

<h2>Editing or Deleting a Subscription</h2>

<p>You can delete an existing subscription (or unsubscribe) by clicking on the
<strong>Delete</strong> button in the respective entry corresponding to the subscription you have
made. Similarly you also can edit a subscription (or re-subscribe) that you have made by clicking on
the <strong>Edit</strong> button. Editing a subscription is similar to adding a subscription except
for the fact that the details that you had to enter before will be pre-populated based on the
current subscription details. Once you are done with the changes to the various fields, click on
the <strong>Modify </strong> button to re-subscribe.</p>
