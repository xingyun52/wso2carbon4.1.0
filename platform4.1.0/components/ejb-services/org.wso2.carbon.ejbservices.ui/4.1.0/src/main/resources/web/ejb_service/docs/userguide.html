<h1>EJB Services</h1>

<p>WSO2 Application Server has the ability to expose Enterprise Java Beans (EJB)
as Web services. Once you have the EJB deployed in your application server,
all you have to do is give the WSO2 Application Server the location of the archive
containing the remote interface, enter the details for the interface, and
give the JNDI bean names. The WSO2 Application Server will take care of exposing
the EJB as a Web service. The WSO2 Application Server will communicate with
the EJB using JNDI, which the WS client sees as just another Web service.</p>

<p></p>

    Services</strong>. The <em><strong>EJB Services</strong></em> page
