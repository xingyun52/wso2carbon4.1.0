<h1>ESB Artifact Uploader</h1>

<p>
    ESB artifacts are custom developed extensions that can be deployed in the ESB. These
    extensions can contain custom mediators, tasks, configuration factories and serializers.
    ESB artifacts packed into .jar or .xar format could be hot-deployed in ESB using ESB Artifact
    Uploader feature.
</p>

<h2>Deploying ESB Artifacts</h2>
