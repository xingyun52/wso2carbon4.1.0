<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>RSS Manager is a mechanism that provides its users with an easy to use management console
    to manipulate all their data related to applications running on a particular domain.
</p>

<h2 id="addInstance">Add a sample Database Server Instance</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to add your own RDS instances to the system, you can use the "Database Server
    Instance" option which can be located under the "Configure" menu of the management console.
    You can fill up the fields depending on your preference and add your RDS instance to the
    system to be used as a data store for the applications running under your tenant domain.

<h2 id="addDatabase">Create a database inside the added Database Server Instance</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The first step in the process of consuming WSO2 Relational Storage Service is to create a
    database for your application in the WSO2 RSS storage space. As the figure below depicts,
    the WSO2_RSS option together with the set of your own RDS instances that are configured to be used to
    manipulate your application data, will be listed out in the select box which carries the label
    "Database Server Instance Name". There you can either use WSO2 Relational Storage Service or
    your own RDS instances to create and consume your database. Once you select your preferred storage
    solution, you can then proceed with the creation of your database. The user is given the ability
    to specify a preferred name for the database under "Database Name". Once you click on the create
    button after fulfilling the aforementioned requirements, you will be able to create the database
    of your own choice to store the application data manipulated within your own domain.sole
    to manipulate all their data related to applications running on a particular domain.

<h2 id="addUser">Add a database user</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this step, the users are given control over coming up with their own permission schemes that
    will be granted to their database users later. As the figure below shows, it's simply a matter
    of selecting the permission just by clicking on the check boxes associated with a particular
    database permission which helps you avoid tedious tasks such as writing lengthy SQL queries and
    executing them to grant database privileges for a particular database user.</p>

<p><img style="border: 1px solid black; width: 600px;" src="images/add_priv_group.png" alt="Create a database privilege group"/></p>

<p><img style="border: 1px solid black; width: 600px;" src="images/list_out_priv_groups.png"
     alt="Listing out already created database privilege groups"/></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
    The "Add new user" user interface allows you to specify a name and a password of your choice for
    a particular user. It also lists down the prvilege groups that you created under step 1 so that
    you can select the appropriate permission scheme which is intended to grant the database user.
    Once you successfully fulfill the above requirements and click the save button which can be
    located at the bottom of the image, a database user will be created to be used in the data
    manipulative tasks carried out in your tenant domain.

<h2 id="exploreDatabase">Explore your database</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Having successfully created a database and attached a database user, you now need to configure
    your database so that it suits your own requirements. This task is also made quite simple with
    the database explorer that we've integrated into the database management user interface by which
    you can execute your desired SQL schemas to configure the database the way you prefer. To get
    you redirected to the database explorer, click on the "Explore Database" option listed under the
    "Actions" category in the "Database Users" page.
