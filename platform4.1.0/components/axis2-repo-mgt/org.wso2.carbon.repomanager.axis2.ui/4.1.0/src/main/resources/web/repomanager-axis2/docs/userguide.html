<h1>Upload shared Axis2 Artifacts</h1>


<p>
    The WSO2 SOA platform has the capability of deploying Axis2 services service as an archive file.
    You can bundle all your service-related resources, service classes, and third-party libraries
    and then deploy the archive file. Some of these service archives might require additional
    libraries, which could be shared between multiple service archives. The Axis2 Repository Manager
    provides the ability to upload these common libraries to the Axis2 Repository and remove
    uploaded
    shared libraries that are no longer necessary.
</p>

<h2>Uploading common Axis2 libraries</h2>

<p>
    To upload shared libraries all that need to be done is clicking on the <strong>Add
    Artifact</strong>
    link next to the relevant <em><strong>lib</strong></em> directory icon. This will upload
    libraries
    that can be used by Axis2 artifacts that are deployed under the <em><strong>Parent
    directory</strong></em>
    of that particular <strong>lib</strong> directory.
</p>

<p>
    For example, uploading libraries to the <strong>lib</strong> directory of
    <strong>axis2services</strong>
    will upload libraries that would be shared by Axis2 artifacts deployed under <strong>axis2services</strong>
    directory etc. Clicking on the <strong>Add Artifact</strong> link will redirect you to the
    Artifact
    upload page. This page displays the Axis2 service type that could share the particular library
    that is being
    uploaded and the directory structure of where the library is being saved to.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the <strong>axis2services</strong> directory's lib to upload libraries will redirect
    to an upload page as displayed in the below.

</p>

<p>
    Multiple artifacts can be uploaded at once by clicking the <strong>+</strong> button.
</p>

<h2>Deleting common Axis2 libraries</h2>

<p>
    To delete a artifact, you simply need to click on the trash can icon next to library, as shown
    in the
    image below.
</p>

</p>

<h2>Restarting the Axis2 server</h2>

<p>
    In order to load the newly uploaded common libraries, the Axis2 server should be restarted.
    If a restart is required, a message will be displayed prompting to restart the Axis2 server.
    In order to restart the Axis2 server, simply click on the link that appears along with the
    message.
</p>

<p>
    <img alt="" src="../images/restart.gif" height="105" width="937" border="1px"/>
</p>

<p>
    Note that the restart option will be available only if libraries has been uploaded via the
    Axis2 Repository Manager, but the Axis2 server has not been restarted.
