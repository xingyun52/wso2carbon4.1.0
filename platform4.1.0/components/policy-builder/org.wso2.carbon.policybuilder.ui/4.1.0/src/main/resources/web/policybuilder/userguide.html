<h1>The Policy Editor User Guide<br></h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>The
Policy Editor allows you to edit WS-Policy documents using either a
graphical editor or a plain text editor. Given a policy URL, it will
generate a graphical tree view (Policy Tree) representing the document
along with the plain text representation. <br><br>By using the right
click context menu of the Policy Tree, you can add new elements and
delete existing ones. The plain text representation will be kept in
sync with the changes done using the Policy Tree vise versa. <br><br>Selecting
an element in the Policy Tree allows you to edit the attributes of that
policy element. Similarly, when adding an element, you will be prompted
to add data to the attributes relevant to that particular element.<br><br>Once you are done editing
your Policy Document, you can save it by clicking the 'Save Source' button.<br><br>
