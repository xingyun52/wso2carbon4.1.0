<h1>Database Explorer</h1>

<p>Database explorer provides the functionality to explorer your database as it named. It basically provides a user interface
to access any type of a database.</p>

<p>Copy the database driver to CARBON_HOME/repository/components/lib directory and restart the server before you try to
login to the database.</p>

<p><b>Login</b></p>
<p>You can select the database type from the drop down of the Saved Settings, which will help you by auto filling the Driver Class
and sample JDBC Url. By giving the user name and password credentials click on connect button to connect to the database. Test Connection
button will help you to test the database connection before you login to the database.</p>

<p><b>Run Query</b></p>

enter your queries under sql statement and click on run button to execute the query.</p>
