<h1>Deploying Service Archives</h1>



<p>The WSO2 SOA platform has the capability of Axis2 to deploy a service as
an archive file. You can bundle all your service-related resources, service
classes, and third-party libraries and then deploy the archive file. </p>

<p>To deploy the service, all you have to do is locate
the archive file and upload it. </p>

<h2>Uploading Service Archive Files</h2>

<p>To upload your service archive file, you first need to have all the class
files and the service.xml files in the archive directory. Thereafter, you can
create the archive file. </p>

<p>The folder structure of the service archive file will be as follows.</p>

<p><strong>Test.aar</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>META-INF</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 4em;"><strong>Services.xml</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;"><strong>Test.class</strong></p>

<p>Figure 1: Uploading service archive files</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the navigator, under Manage/Service, click <strong>AAR
    Service</strong>. The <em><strong>Add Service Archive</strong></em>
    window appears.</li>
  <li>Provide the hierarchical path of the service. This is optional. If you want to manage
      services separately, specifying a heirarchy is important. This allows you to customise
      your service EPR as you wish. And also it allows you to manage multiple versions of the
      same service changing only the business logic.
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider a service "Version"</p>
      <p>If no service hierarchy -> EPR is ../services/Version</p>
      <p>With service hierarchy foo/bar/1.0.0 -> EPR is ../services/foo/bar/1.0.0/Version</p>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Browse</strong> to locate the file you want to
  upload.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Upload</strong>.
    The <em><strong>Deployed Services</strong></em> page
    appears. Subsequently, if the service is successful, it will appear in
    the Service Groups table. If the service is faulty, a Faulty Service
    Groups link will appear. You can click the link to view the errors.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Testing the Service</h2>

<p>A successful service can be easily tested through the user
interface.Several options are available to control your service.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the navigator, under Manage/Service, click <strong>List</strong>.
    The <em><strong>Deployed Services</strong></em> page appears.</li>
  <li>Click on the service name you want to test. The <em><strong>Service
    Dashboard</strong></em> page appears.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Try the service</strong> on the Client Operations
  panel.</li>
  <li>A page with your service name appears. It contains the operations
    available for your service.</li>
  <li>Give the parameters for the operations you want to invoke.</li>
  <li>Click the button at the bottom of the window. This button displays the
    name of the operation you have selected.</li>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Instead of using this user interface, you can also manually place
the .aar containing all the required files
into CARBON_HOME/repository/services.  These archive files can be deployed
as services. </p>

<h2>Generating the Client</h2>

<p>You can generate the client for your service using the WSO2 Web service
Application Server (WSO2 WSAS).</p>

</ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: The quality of the service can be managed through the features and
options available in the Quality of Service Configuration panel on the
<em><strong>Service Dashboard</strong></em> page.</p>
