This folder contain some usage scripts to invoke nova scripts to install and manage openstack installation
Scripts are only tested for Ubnutu Precise 12.04 LTS.
Steps:
Download openstack installer scripts from git
git clone https://github.com/uksysadmin/OpenStackInstaller.git

cd OpenStackInstaller

git checkout essex

Copy all scripts from this folder into the newly created OpenStackInstaller folder

To install a new controller modify oscontrollerinstall.sh and execute

To install a new compute node modify oscomputeinstall.sh and execute

To uninstall a controller/compute node modify osuninstall.sh and execute

To restart services in the controller/compute node execute restartservices.sh

To upload an image to glance serve
Copy the image to /root/upload folder, modify uploadimage.sh and execute

IMPORTANT:
When installing the compute node OSinstall.sh script should be changed as following

       #nova-manage network create ${VMNET} ${NUM_NETWORKS} ${NETWORK_SIZE}
       nova-manage network create vmnet --fixed_range_v4=${VMNET} --network_size=${NETWORK_SIZE} --bridge_interface=${PRIVATE_INTERFACE}

Also replace nova-compute-kvm with nova-compute-lxc(This is to specifically install lxc support instead of default kvm)

If you use a single machine to install openstack you need to install controller. Then in the same machine a compute node is installed as well. To add new compute nodes to the system you need to install compute nodes in to newly added machines.
