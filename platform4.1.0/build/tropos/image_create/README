This folder contain utilities to create customized images from the downloadable Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud images.

For LXC images don't download the qcow2 images, but download the tar.gz file from
For example to download ubuntu precise, visit
http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/precise/current/
and look for the image

precise-server-cloudimg-amd64.tar.gz    30-Jun-2012 05:51  210M  Cloud image for 64-bit computers (Cloud Image/EC2 tarball)

ubuntu-12.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.tar.gz

Create a folder of your choice. eg:/opt/lxc (you will pass this folder as <image root> in the following command with option -r).
Above step is optional. If you don't pass the image root path then /tmp is taken as default.

Put the downloaded image into a folder of your choice. You will pass this image name with the path as mandatory argument when creating the image.

Now you can mount and customize this image(resize, install new packages etc) using the scripts provided in this folder.

For example to install lamp packages into the ubuntu precise image do the following

stratos-image -t<template> create <path to the original image including name>
Eg:
stratos-image -r/opt/lxc -tlamp -n3G create ubuntu-12.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.tar.gz

Optional arguments
-r - <image root> folder. Put the new image into <image root>/image folder
-t - template to customize the image
-n - The original image will be resized to this size. (in Giga bytes)
-s - Additional software to copy into the instances /opt folder. If you give more than one software package, separate them by colons(:)

Mandatory arguments
<action> - Action is one of create or pack

When action is create
<original image name prefixed with path> - path to original image archive(.tar.gz)

When action is pack
<new image name> - path to original image archive(.tar.gz)

This command will mount the original image,  resize the image to 3G and install lamp packages.

Now you can pack the image with a new name and unmount the original image using following command

stratos-image -t<template> pack <name of the new image>
Eg:
stratos-image -r/opt/lxc -tlamp pack ubuntu-12.04-server-jetty-cloudimg-amd64.tar.gz

In the init_scripts/lamp folder you can see that their are lamp specific scripts that will be copied into the instances /opt folder. The init_scripts/lamp/payload folder is a sample payload that would be passed to a lamp instance.

You can provide your own template instead of lamp in the above command. To do that you need to implement your own template in configure_software file. To do that you can learn how it is done for lamp template in the the same file. Copying the lamp() template function into a new funciton say myfunc() and customizing it, is the best approach.

Also you can create init_scripts/<your template name> folder and create a payload for your instance(optional). Also in init_scripts/<your template name> folder you can create whatever scripts you need to copy into your instances and update your template function to copy those scripts to the instances.

Another template included is wso2_carbon_server template. This template is used to create WSO2 carbon servers.

In the init_scripts/carbon folder you can see that their are carbon server instance specific scripts that will be copied into the wso2 carbon instance's /opt folder. The init_scripts/carbon/payload folder is a sample payload that would be passed to a carbon server instance.

The exact carbon server to be started in the carbon server instance, is decided by the parameters passed in the payload passed to the Carbon instance at load time.
